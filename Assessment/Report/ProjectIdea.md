# Project Idea

## Title: Audio-based Chinese-English differentiation using deep learning


---

## Idea: 


**I want my project to be able to classify 'English' and 'Chinese' using microphone on my arduino**


1. *e.g. detect when i say "wotcha", recognise a bird in a live camera stream etc*
2. *e.g. camera, microphone, accelerometer etc*
3. *e.g. arduino, laptop, RPi etc*

---

## Data:
The data is from recording different people speaking 'deep learning' and '深度学习‘(deep learning in Chinese)
